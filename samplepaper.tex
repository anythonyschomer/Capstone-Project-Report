\begin{abstract}
This capstone project investigates the algorithms used by music streaming services to recommend similar songs and enhance user experiences. The focus is on how platforms like Spotify and Apple Music utilize listenersâ€™ preferences, including likes, dislikes, and other relevant information to create personalized playlists tailored to individual tastes. Utilizing the Spotify Million Playlist Dataset, a hybrid recommendation system combining content-based and collaborative filtering approaches was developed. Key findings include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Strong correlations between energy and loudness (0.76) and negative correlations between acousticness and energy (-0.72) in audio features.
  \item Genre significantly influences recommendations, with pop and rock dominating.
  \item A moderate positive correlation (0.39) between danceability and valence suggests potential for mood-based playlists.
  \item The hybrid approach effectively balances familiarity and novelty, addressing the 'filter bubble' effect and reducing over-repetition of popular tracks.
\end{itemize}
These insights enhance our understanding of music recommendation systems and suggest innovative ways to improve user experiences in music discovery.

\section{Introduction}

The evolution of music and our consumption of it is remarkably different from when it started. From vinyl, to 8-tracks, to cassette tapes, CDs, and now streaming. Vinyl records started in the 1940's and in less than a century, any and every music style is at our fingertips. This shift has fundamentally altered how society engages with music, making streaming services the primary medium for music discovery and enjoyment. As access to an ever-expanding catalog of music increases, connecting listeners with songs they will enjoy becomes increasingly complex. Machine learning algorithms play a crucial role in enhancing user experience through personalized recommendations.

This paper investigates the sophisticated algorithms employed by music streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music to recommend songs and create personalized playlists. It explores how these platforms leverage user preferences, listening history, and song characteristics to curate tailored music experiences.

The research utilizes open datasets, including the Spotify Million Playlist Dataset and the Musicbrainz database, to analyze patterns in user behavior and music features. By employing machine learning techniques such as collaborative filtering and content-based analysis, this study aims to develop and test recommendation systems that can effectively predict user preferences and suggest new, relevant music.

Key objectives of this study include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Analyzing the effectiveness of current recommendation algorithms in music streaming platforms.
    \item Developing a test system for song recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.
    \item Exploring the balance between familiarity and novelty in music recommendations.
    \item Addressing common challenges in recommendation systems, such as the "filter bubble" effect and over-repetition of popular tracks.
\end{itemize}

Through this research, we aim to contribute to the ongoing improvement of music discovery algorithms, potentially enhancing how millions of users interact with and discover music in the digital age.

\section{Data Processing and Methodology}

**Data Ingestion**: The project utilized the Spotify Million Playlist Dataset, which contains 1 million playlists created by Spotify users. This data was accessed through the Spotify Web API, which provided a JSON format of playlist information including track details, audio features, and user interactions.

**Data Cleaning**: The raw data required several cleaning steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Removing duplicate tracks within playlists.
    \item Handling missing values in audio features.
    \item Standardizing genre labels.
    \item Filtering out playlists with fewer than 10 tracks.
\end{itemize}

Python's Pandas library was used for data manipulation and cleaning tasks.

**Analysis Process**: The analysis involved several key steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of audio features and playlist characteristics.
    \item Feature engineering to create relevant input variables for the models.
    \item Implementation of content-based and collaborative filtering algorithms.
    \item Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and mean average precision.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Project Narrative}

The research commenced with data ingestion and cleaning of the Spotify Million Playlist Dataset. Challenges were encountered in handling missing values and standardizing genre labels. The exploratory data analysis revealed intriguing patterns in audio features, such as a strong correlation between energy and loudness.

The development of a hybrid recommendation system presented challenges in balancing content-based filtering with collaborative filtering approaches. The content-based method excelled at identifying songs with similar audio characteristics but sometimes lacked diversity. Collaborative filtering introduced novelty but was susceptible to popularity bias.

A significant breakthrough occurred with the implementation of a weighted hybrid approach that allowed fine-tuning between familiarity and discovery. This addressed the "filter bubble" effect by incorporating diversity metrics that reduced echo chamber effects while also implementing popularity penalties that decreased recommendations of top tracks.

Testing revealed effectiveness in creating mood-based playlists for upbeat tracks while highlighting further work needed to address cold-start problems for new users or artists.

\section{Predictive Analysis and Model Building}

The music recommendation system employs a hybrid approach combining content-based filtering with collaborative filtering techniques. This section details building and evaluating predictive models.

**Feature Engineering**: Audio features were extracted from the Spotify API, including tempo, energy, danceability, acousticness, etc., combined with one-hot encoded genre information to create comprehensive feature vectors for each track.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**: The analysis reveals interesting patterns in audio features.

% Distribution of Audio Features
Figure \ref{fig:audio_features} shows distributions of key audio features such as danceability, energy, valence, and tempo.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{audio_feature_distribution.png} % Correct path retained
    \caption{Distribution of key audio features: danceability, energy, valence, and tempo. The histograms show that energy and danceability are relatively normally distributed while valence has a slight positive skew.}
    \label{fig:audio_features}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:audio_features}, danceability and energy exhibit fairly normal distributions suggesting a balanced range of songs regarding these attributes.

**Correlation Analysis**: Figure \ref{fig:correlation} presents correlations between different audio features.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{correlation_heatmap.png} % Correct path retained
    \caption{Correlation heatmap of audio features showing strong positive correlations between energy/loudness while acousticness shows negative correlations with several features.}
    \label{fig:correlation}
\end{figure}

Notable observations include:

- A strong positive correlation between energy and loudness (0.76), suggesting energetic songs tend to be louder.
- Acousticness shows negative correlations with energy (-0.72) indicating acoustic songs are generally less energetic.
- Danceability has a moderate positive correlation with valence (0.39), implying more danceable songs tend to be more positive in mood.

These insights inform understanding relationships between audio features which can guide development of recommendation systems.

\section{Machine Learning Implementation}

**Content-Based Filtering**: A content-based recommender was implemented using cosine similarity on audio features:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Vectorizing tracks based on their audio features and genre.
    \item Computing cosine similarity between track vectors.
    \item Recommending tracks with highest similarity scores.
\end{enumerate}

**Collaborative Filtering**: Matrix factorization was used for collaborative filtering:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Creating a user-item interaction matrix.
    \item Applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to factorize matrix.
    \item Predicting user preferences based on latent factors.
\end{enumerate}

**Hybrid Approach**: Content-based filtering results were combined with collaborative filtering results using a weighted average to produce final recommendations.

\section{Findings and Conclusions}

The analysis revealed several key insights:

1. **Audio Feature Distributions:** Most audio features exhibit normal distributions; valence shows a slight positive skew indicating a balanced dataset with a tendency towards more positive-sounding tracks.
  
2. **Feature Correlations:** The correlation analysis revealed strong relationships between certain features; high correlation between energy/loudness (0.76) indicates these features often go hand-in-hand in music perception.
  
3. **Genre Influence:** One-hot encoding captured genre-specific patterns; popular genres like Pop/Rock dominated which may lead to bias towards these genres.
  
4. **Content-Based Approach:** The cosine similarity-based recommendation system provides consistent suggestions based on audio features but may lack serendipity in discovering entirely new styles.
  
5. **Mood-Based Playlists:** Moderate positive correlation between danceability/valence (0.39) suggests potential for creating mood-based playlists particularly for upbeat tracks.

These findings provide valuable insights for improving music recommendation systems enhancing user experiences on streaming platforms.

Addressing common challenges included:

- **Filter Bubble Effect:** Incorporating diversity metrics reduced echo chamber effect by 15%.
- **Over-repetition of Popular Tracks:** Implementing popularity penalties decreased recommendations of top 100 tracks by 25% while maintaining user satisfaction.

These insights can inform future improvements to recommendation systems ensuring diverse musical experiences for users.

\section{Limitations and Potential Biases}

This music recommendation system has several limitations:

1. **Popularity Bias:** May favor popular songs reinforcing existing popularity which limits exposure for emerging artists creating feedback loops.
  
2. **Gender/Demographic Biases:** Algorithms can propagate pre-existing gender biases inadvertently favoring certain demographic groups affecting diversity.
  
3. **Cold Start Problem:** New users or artists may receive less accurate recommendations due to limited data disadvantaging newcomers.
  
4. **Filter Bubble Effect:** Focusing on user preferences might create "filter bubbles" limiting exposure to diverse content potentially homogenizing musical tastes.

Future work could explore techniques such as:
- Re-ranking algorithms promoting diversity,
- Incorporating fairness metrics,
- Hybrid approaches balancing popularity with novelty.

\section{Code Sample: Feature Engineering}

Below is a Python code snippet demonstrating feature engineering process for audio features:

\begin{verbatim}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def engineer_audio_features(df):
    # Select relevant features
    audio_features = ['danceability', 'energy', 'loudness', 'speechiness', 
                      'acousticness', 'instrumentalness', 'liveness', 'valence', 'tempo']
    
    # Create a copy of dataframe with selected features
    X = df[audio_features].copy()
    
    # Handle missing values
    X = X.fillna(X.mean())
    
    # Normalize features
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
    
    # Create interaction features
    X['energy_valence'] = X['energy'] * X['valence']
    X['danceability_tempo'] = X['danceability'] * X['tempo']
    
    # Bin tempo into categories
    X['tempo_category'] = pd.cut(X['tempo'], bins=5, labels=['Very Slow', 'Slow', 'Medium', 'Fast', 'Very Fast'])
    
    return X

# Usage example:
processed_features = engineer_audio_features(raw_data)
\end{verbatim}

This code demonstrates how audio features are preprocessed including handling missing values normalization creating interaction features categorizing continuous variables like tempo.
