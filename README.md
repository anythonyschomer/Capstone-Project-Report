## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding the dataset and uncovering patterns that inform our recommendation algorithms.

### Key Findings
- **Distribution of Audio Features**: The distribution of key audio features such as danceability, energy, and tempo was analyzed.
- **Insights**: The analysis provided insights into how different audio features relate to each other and their potential impact on user preferences.

### Conclusion
The insights gained from the EDA will guide the development of our recommendation system by highlighting important features that influence user preferences.

## Machine Learning Component
