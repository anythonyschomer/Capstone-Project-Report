## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding the dataset and uncovering patterns that inform our recommendation algorithms.

### Key Findings
- **Distribution of Audio Features**: The distribution of key audio features such as danceability, energy, and tempo was analyzed.
- **Correlation Analysis**: A correlation analysis was performed to understand relationships between different audio features.

### Visualizations
#### 1. Distribution of Danceability

*Figure 1: This histogram shows the distribution of danceability scores across tracks, indicating a balanced dataset with a slight skew towards higher danceability.*

#### 2. Correlation Heatmap

*Figure 2: The correlation heatmap illustrates strong positive correlations between energy and loudness, suggesting that more energetic songs tend to be louder.*

### Conclusion
The insights gained from the EDA will guide the development of our recommendation system by highlighting important features that influence user preferences.
